* System and package manager
I use Arch Linux. So most of the dependencies are installed via
pacman, or paru, which is an AUR helper.

On macOS, just use homebrew.

* Editor
I use Emacs as the text editor, nothing else. I use eglot for lsp support.

* Compiler
- clang

* Install required packages via package manager
Arch
#+begin_src shell
  paru -S clang vulkan-devel sdl2
#+end_src

macOS (clang is already installed on macOS, usually with xcode)
#+begin_src shell
  brew install vulkan sdl2
#+end_src
